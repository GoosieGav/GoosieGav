# Hey, I'm Gavin! 

I'm a Junior in high school with a deep passion for **Python**, **Data Science**, and developing exciting projects that push my boundaries. I’ve built a solid foundation in **Machine Learning**, and now I’m diving into the fascinating world of **Deep Learning**. I’m also getting hands-on with essential Data Science tools like **Pandas** and **NumPy** to handle data more efficiently.

### Projects I’ve Developed

- [**Ensemble Learning for Malware Detection**](https://github.com/GoosieGav/Ensemble-Learning-for-Malware-Classification): I created an ensemble learning model combining multiple algorithms to boost accuracy and robustness in malware detection. (Research done with professors)
  
- [**PestHUB**](https://github.com/GoosieGav/PestHub): Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), I developed a system to identify pests and suggest sustainable treatment options. 

- **3D Dystopian Game with Three.js**: I helped build a dark, immersive 3D dystopian game using **Three.js**, where players explore a futuristic world full of challenges.

### What’s Next?

- I’m excited to **combine my love for soccer** with **Deep Learning**. I plan to explore how machine learning can analyze player performance, strategies, and other aspects of the game.
  
- I’m diving deeper into **Computer Vision** and **Natural Language Processing**, and I aim to **publish independent research papers** as I continue my studies.
